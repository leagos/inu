      <description>Article 1: Financial Non-Responsibility Clause Investing money, speculating and trading is risky, and you will always be the only responsible for your actions.
Remember to NEVER invest more than you can afford to lose.
Article 2: Informative Non-Responsibility Clause Website content and Telegram flux do NOT engage the CAESAR SHIBA team, and is not guaranteed in any way.
As an example, the roadmap is purely informative and represents our team goals if everything works perfectly, which may obviously not always be possible.</description>
